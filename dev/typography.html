          <p class="dropcap">Making money online is a kind of everyone’s dream job. No investments are needed and you can do whatever you need to do when you are in the mood or have free time. Flexible work schedule is something you’ll hardly get working at the office. However, online business rarely starts to bring you money from the very first day. It takes some time as a rule. But once you understand the whole process (like what are your abilities, where to work, for whom to work and so on) you'll be earning money in no time.</p>
